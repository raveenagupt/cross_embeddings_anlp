# Machine Empathy Across Borders: English-Zulu Cross-Lingual Embeddings
## 11-711: Advanced Natural Language Processing
## Group 2: Raveena Gupta, Balaji Sathyanarayanan, Tabish Shaik

This GitHub repository contains the code we used for our Advanced NLP project on English-Zulu Cross-Lingual Embeddings.

The two Jupyter Notebooks in the main directory contain the code we used to generate our final results, and the `development_code` contains code we used for testing and results reported earlier in the project in Assignment 3.

Please let us know if you have any questions!

Thank you!
